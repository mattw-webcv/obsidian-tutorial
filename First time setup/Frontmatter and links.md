## Frontmatter properties and classes

For those familiar with programming classes:
Frontmatter properties are in the same vein as programming classes.
This also includes CSS for website design..

Properties have many types to choose from which impact how you fill out the property.
The properties are not some imposition of authority. They're enforced through consistency of agreement.

So, this tutorial has an included property class not found in the barebones Obsidian install.
Neighbours- of class list.
I enforce the class, by listing (as links) all the things I've decided are neighbours.


## Links
There are 2 main links, internal and external (to outside obsidian).
There are 2 different components of links.
Link, and alias (shorthand reference name.
The order of link and alias depends on if it's internal or external.

A link is created by double square brackets
A link alias is used with the pipe '|'
There should be no spaces between the link and alias.

For example, highlight these links:
[[Frontmatter and links|Frontmatter]]
