### Comparing markdown to other file formats

Obsidian is mostly a strictly markdown text editer.
Markdown is a simplified markup language which doesn't need interpreting or rendering as code. This means raw markdown and content can be directly transplanted into any text editor or notepad file without errors.

This is in contrast with say the microsoft office formatting system; where renaming the (.docx) extension to .txt makes the contents unreadable.

There are various plugins for obsidian which add features designed to streamline and expand on the basic markdown language/coding.

Plugins, frontmatter formatting, and settings are where non markdown (md) coding is used, but this point is only relevant for people learning about those languages and formatting systems.

To see the differences between markdown and other formatting languages:
Open one of these markdown files in a text editor such as windows notepad.
Now you've seen what markdown code looks like normally.

Then, separately find a microsoft office file such as a .docx or .doc.
Make a copy of it in the same folder and rename the extension from .docx to .txt
This will tell the OS to use notepad instead of microsoft office when opening the file.

Then try to open that renamed file with windows notepad, and see whether or not you can easily read the content. This is what the text editor sees when reading the raw data of the file.

This comparison demonstrates what is described as human readable code, or human friendly code.
