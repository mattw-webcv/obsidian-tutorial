## Frontmatter properties and classes
---
For those familiar with programming classes:
Frontmatter properties are classes, and they operate as programming classes in the more generic sense.
This also includes CSS for website design..

Front matter properties can be clicked on and have many types to choose from which impact how you fill out the property.
The way a property class operates is simply by consistency and repetition.
They are not some heirarchical top down imposition of authority.
Properties are created by simply creating one, and then it is available from the dropdown menu
next time you create a property.

Further, property items can also be links, as shown in this tutorial.
This is triggered in Obsidian by double square opening brackets '[['

## Links
---
There are 2 main links, internal and external (to outside obsidian).
There are 2 different components of links. Though only the link is needed.
Link, and alias (shorthand reference name).
The order of link and alias depends on if it's internal or external.

A link is created by double square brackets
A link alias is used with the pipe '|'
There should be no spaces between the link and alias.

For example, highlight these links:
[[Frontmatter and links|Frontmatter]]
