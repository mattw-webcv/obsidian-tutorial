This page will go over initial impressions of the ui (user interface).
Starting with the top, reading left to right.

### Top bar: The very top horizontal pane

### Side bar toggles
The little sidebar button is first of 2.
One on the far left, the other to the far right.
These collapse and expand for viewing plugins.
The left sidebar deals more with viewing your vault/working directory.
The right sidebar deals with secondary plugins around managing and organising the vault.
These sidebars will be your most commonly used spaces other than the main content workspace.

At the bottom of the left sidebar are the vault selection menu, and 2 buttons.
The gear icon for settings gives you customisation of the vault.

### Tabs
Just as you'd view firefox or chrome tabs.
-Left mouse button opens the file, replacing whatever you have open.
-Mouse wheel click opens in new tab
-Right click is context menu
-A nuanced but convenient feature is "Split right"- this opens a tab on the right side, creating a side-by-side 'book' view of tabs.

### Left vertical shortcut icons
Commonly referenced plugins/commands/shortcuts will be listed here

##  Main content view

- This is the main content workspace

At the top, are various things
- Such as arrow navigation
- Centred is the current directory of the file being worked on
- On the right is a toggle for switching between reader/editor/source code view
	- This can be tricky and unintuitive to interact with, but the toggle only applies to the current opened tab. Which means closing and reopening the tab resets the view
- The 3 vertical dots are a button shortcut for the various right-mouse-button context menu options

The main window has 3 areas
- Top (For filename/Header/Title)
- 'Frontmatter' (metadata saved in the same file as the data)
- Content

The top title is self explanatory and easy to recognise.

Adding frontmatter in a way Obsidian recognises requires the use of the immediate line below the title line.
If you type the trigger in the top line under the title, Obsidian gives you dropdown property menus for frontmatter.
If you type the 3x hyphens in a row on the second line after the Title, you get:

### Settings

The settings pane is relatively self explanatory, with the following exceptions:

### General > Account:
The usefulness of being signed in is not stated in Obsidian settings.
The practical benefits of an account really depend on paying for the online services.

### Hotkeys>
Are very useful and convenient and save lots of time.
However best use of hotkeys involves building/having habits.

### Core plugins>
There are many core plugins, and none of them are obvious to the novice.
My advice is disable all of them until you're familiar with Obsidian and have a workflow.
At that time, gradually test each plugin separately in isolation to get a feel for them.

Brief mention on core plugins:
To begin, only enable:
Files, Note composer, Outgoing links, Page preview, Properties view, Search, Slides, Tags view, Templates, Word count

File recovery only monitors and tracks markdown content, which means it doesn't work for canvas or other productivity things available to Obsidian.

Workspaces refers to arrangement of workspace tabs being split horizontally and vertically.
This is an advanced, and niche feature. It does not refer to the sidebars.

Other notes:
Command palette, search, slash commands, and quick switcher are all oriented around familiarity with hotkeys.

Sync and Publish involve paying for online sync service.

Templates involve assigning a folder to be the template folder, and then adding files into that folder you want to use as templates.

### Community plugins>
By default, restricted mode is turned on.
Restricted mode means community plugins cannot be browsed and installed.

#### Examples of community plugins
Git backup (simple commit and sync repo to index, and remote source)

- More featureful expansions on checklists, tables, tasks, and templates
- Slides for presentations
- Mind maps
- Ledger
- Basic code linting
- etc
