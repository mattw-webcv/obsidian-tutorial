### This page will go over initial impressions of the user interface
Starting with the top, reading left to right.

#### Top bar: The very top horizontal pane
---

##### Side bar toggles
There are 2 sidebar buttons. One on the far left, the other to the far right. These collapse and expand for viewing plugins.
The left sidebar deals more with viewing your vault/working directory.

The right sidebar deals with secondary plugins around managing and organising the vault.
These sidebars will be your most commonly used spaces other than the main content workspace.

At the bottom of the left sidebar are the vault selection menu, and 2 buttons.
The gear icon for settings gives you customisation of the vault.

##### Tabs
Just as you'd view firefox or chrome tabs.
Click on files in your sidebar to open into tabs.
- Left mouse button opens the file into a tab, replacing whatever you currently have open.
- Mouse wheel click opens in new tab
- Right click is context menu
- A nuanced but convenient feature is "Split right"- this opens a tab on the right side, creating a side-by-side 'book' view of tabs. This split view will be referenced later in the workspace plugin.

#### Ribbon shortcuts
---
Below the left sidebar toggle is the ribbon.
It is the thin vertical strip left of the left sidebar.
Commonly referenced plugins/commands/shortcuts will be listed here.

##  Main content view
---
- This is the main content workspace

At the top, are various things, such as:
- Arrow navigation on the left
- Centred is the current directory of the file being worked on
- On the right is a toggle for switching between reader/editor/source code view
	- This can be tricky and unintuitive to interact with, but the toggle only applies to the current opened tab. Which means closing and reopening the tab resets the view
- The 3 vertical dots are a button shortcut for the various right-mouse-button context menu options

The main window has 3 areas
- Top (For filename/Header/Title)
- 'Frontmatter' (metadata saved in the same file as the data)
- Content

The top title is self explanatory and easy to recognise.

Adding frontmatter in a way Obsidian recognises requires the use of the line immediately below the title.
If you type the trigger (---), Obsidian gives you dropdown menus for creating frontmatter.
If you type the 3x hyphens in a row below the frontmatter line, you get:

### Settings
---

The settings pane is relatively self explanatory, with the following exceptions:

#### General > Account:
The usefulness of being signed in is not stated in Obsidian settings. The practical benefits of an account really depend on paying for the online services.

#### Hotkeys>
Are very useful and convenient and save lots of time.
However best use of hotkeys involves building/having habits.

#### Core plugins>
There are many core plugins, and some of them aren't obvious to the novice. My advice is only enable a few of them until you're familiar with Obsidian and have a workflow. At that time, gradually test each plugin to get a feel for them. The simple action of toggling a plugin will usually give immediate and noticeable results. Therefore this is your first clue when investigating which plugin does what.

Brief mention on core plugins:
For the unobvious plugins, begin by only enabling:
Files, Outgoing links, Page preview, Properties view, Search, Slides, Tags view, Templates, Word count

File recovery only monitors and tracks markdown content, which means it doesn't work for canvas or other productivity things available to Obsidian.

Workspaces refers to 'split view' arrangement of 'workspace' tabs being split horizontally and vertically.

###### Other notes:
Command palette, search, slash, and quick switcher are all oriented around familiarity with commands. The command palette in particular will be an invaluable tool for the touch-typist to quickly finding whatever command they want to input; be this open settings, toggle plugin, open new file, restore from backup, or switch git branch.

Sync and Publish involve paying for online sync service.

Templates involve assigning a folder to be the template folder, and then adding files into that folder you want to use as templates.

##### Community plugins>
By default, restricted mode is turned on.
Restricted mode means community plugins cannot be browsed and installed. For a brief reference of the most broadly used community plugins, see below.
