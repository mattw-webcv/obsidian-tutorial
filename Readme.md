## Obsidian is free to use and very competent.
This tutorial will enable you to achieve 90% of what obsidian is capable of. Upon downloading and installing Obsidian, run the program and choose a folder to use as a vault.
A 'vault' is simply the folder on your computer Obsidian works within for your projects and organisation.
This vault can be created beforehand by opening file explorer- navigating to where you want to store the vault, and creating a folder with your desired name.
