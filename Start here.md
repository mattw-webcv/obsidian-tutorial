By now, you have Obsidian installed and are potentially faced with many unfamiliar things.
The linked pages will overview the various most commonly used facets of Obsidian.

Obsidian is mostly a strictly markdown text editer.
Markdown is a simplified markup language which doesn't need interpreting or rendering as code. This means raw markdown and content can be directly transplanted into any text editor or notepad file without errors.

This is in contrast with say the microsoft office formatting system; where renaming the (.docx) extension to .txt makes the contents unreadable.


There are various plugins for obsidian which add features designed to streamline and expand on the basic markdown language/coding.


Plugins, frontmatter formatting, and settings are where non markdown (md) coding is used, but this point is only relevant for people learning about those languages and formatting systems.


### Comparing markdown to other file formats
To see the differences between markdown and other formatting languages:
Open one of these markdown files in a text editor such as windows notepad.

Then, separately find a microsoft office file such as a .docx or .doc.
Make a copy of it in the same folder and rename the extension from .docx to .txt

Then try to open that renamed file with windows notepad, and see whether or not you can easily read the content.

## Obsidian is free to use and very competent.
This tutorial will enable you to achieve 90% of what obsidian is capable of with plugins.

A 'vault' is simply the folder you work in and put all your files for organisation.
